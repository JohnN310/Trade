# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock. The model is built using historical stock price data and utilizes the Keras library for creating the LSTM architecture.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the future closing prices of Apple stock using a machine learning model. The model is trained on historical data from 2012 to 2019 and uses the LSTM algorithm, which is particularly suited for time series forecasting.

## Model Overview
The model utilizes the LSTM architecture, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time series data. Below is a brief overview of the steps performed in the script:

Data Collection: Historical stock data for Apple Inc. is collected using the yfinance library.
Data Preprocessing: The data is scaled and split into training and testing datasets.
Model Creation: An LSTM model is built using Keras, consisting of multiple LSTM layers and dense layers.
Model Training: The model is trained on the historical data to learn patterns in the stock prices.
Prediction: The model predicts the closing price of the stock for unseen data, and the results are compared to the actual prices.

## Example Predictions
The script also includes an example of predicting the closing price for a single day (December 18, 2019). The model's prediction is compared with the actual closing price to evaluate its accuracy.
